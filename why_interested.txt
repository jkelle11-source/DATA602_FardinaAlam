Why am I interested in taking DATA602?

My journey to this class began six years ago, when I took my first course on Excel,
required by my Marketing program at Ohio State. I fell in love with the ability of 
spreadsheets to bring order to chaos, and to help us understand the world. While 
researching Excel tips and methods, I came across a post on a forum that said, 
"Excel users find answers. Programmers create solutions." 

The idea behind this quote is that Excel users (like financial analysts, for example) 
approach each dataset as new, creating pivot tables and calculating summary statistics 
from scratch. On the other hand, programmers design ways to gather deeper insight from 
all datasets of a similar type with the mere press of the "Run" button. This notion deeply 
intrigued me, and I signed up for the "Programming Java" class a year later. Working on the 
labs in that class gave me a feeling I've never had before, where the outside world and all 
its stressors totally melted away, leaving only me, my terminal, and the joy of hitting "Run" 
and seeing zero errors.

Following this experience, I fully dove in, signing up for the data science certification 
from DataCamp and exploring ways to apply what I learned in my marketing internships. 
Leveraging the tools that DataCamp gave me led to great success for years, but I was always 
hungry to learn more. This hunger led me to the MSDS program, which to me is an incredible 
opportunity to learn from data scientists at the very forefront of the field, rather than act
as my own mentor as I did with DataCamp. What excites me most about this class is the chance 
to explore the data science process end-to-end, under the guidance of a proven mentor and 
leader in the field. I can't wait to begin.
